            <p class="unica caps b f4">Brief</p>
            <p>This assignment aims to get better understanding of some basic concepts of github, bootstrap and javascript interactions.
              <br>You are expected to create a website that tells the user/visitor about you. Feel free to create your concepts by looking at some inspiration(s) from the internet. We will learn how to animate HTML documents and other javascript interactions.
            </p>
            <li>Select about 10 short-stories from your life, and reflect on how the event/part of your life/story contributed to make you what you are today. You could also make it like a portfolio as something that showcases 10 "works" that you have done in the past and share your process and learnings from each of them.</li>
            <li>Create a narrative that the user will follow to understand you better, since the website is about you.</li>
            <li>Include images with captions for atleast 5 short-stories, and 3 of them should have more than one images.</li>
            <li>Try to make catchy titles for each short-story</li>
