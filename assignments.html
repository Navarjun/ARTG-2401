            <p class="unica caps b f4">Brief</p>
            <li>Produce a 5+ page informational website about a topic of your choice. It may be a personal portfolio or for an organization, cause, event, business, etc that you are interested in. My hope is for you to produce a product that you can host on GitHub Pages (or other) and may continue to develop beyond the scope of this class.</li>

            <p class="unica caps b f4">Requirements</p>
            <li>Your project must be responsive and include some form of navigation throughout your pages. It should demonstrate an understanding of meaningful, semantic HTML &amp; CSS to control typography, layout, transition, interactions, etc. We will be discussing approaches for these in the coming classes.</li>

          <ul>
            <p class="unica caps b f4">Brief</p>
            <li>Select a user flow from your Responsive Design final and create a functional, responsive prototype of it
              <br>
              <br>Include at least 3 pages
              <br><small>(or sections / steps if it is a single page application)</small>
              <br>
              <br>Incorporate user interaction / feedback
              <br><small>(i.e. tooltip, modal, form validation, CSS animation, etc.)</small>
              <br>
              <br>Responsive
              <br><small>You may need to sacrifice some functionality or content, but your prototype should be accessible on mobile and desktop</small></li>

        <p>Those of you that want to focus more on designing your site statically and are using InVision for your RD final, think of this as a fuctional, interactive wireframe. It can be built with your frameworks default styles and focus on layout and functionality
          <br>
          <br>If you choose to code your RD final, simply turn in the same work to me for this class. It is fine if that does not meet all of the requirements above
